# Hi there!

This is your first markdown page. It probably isn't styled much, although
Markdown does support **bold** and _italics._

To learn more about adding a layout to your page, read the next section on **Markdown Layouts.**

## A smaller heading

This is within my _smaller_ heading.

```typescript
const test: string = "Hello world!";
```

### Yet smaller

**SO** small.
